# Video based Benchmarks (COCO Format)

We provide annotation conversion scripts to convert our annotations into the more widely used COCO format.
This allows you to use our annotations with pre-existing methods and codebases for training and testing.

Additionally, you can skip this step by downloading the annotation files for our test set from [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cz1P-fO5bkZSbGhCqE1sABDIHHA74JWz?usp=sharing).
Please download the ```benchmarks``` folder and place under ```./data``` at the same level as other big sequence folders like ```01_tagging ... 07_tennis```.
